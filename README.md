# JLCPCB-KiCad-DRC

JLCPCB Design Rules for KiCad 7.0, implemented as Custom Rules in PCB Editor `File > Board_Setup... > Design Rules > Custom Rules`), and stored in the `.kicad_dru` file.

These rules use some features only available in KiCad 7.0.

Each design rule is validated for PASS/FAIL the associated PCB (`.kicad_pcb`).
